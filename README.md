Here you will find the source code for the game that I made! I uploaded this mainly for backup purposes only. Feel free to use or modify the source code to your liking. Check the game out on Itch! - [Cull of Zombies](https://that0neprogrammer.itch.io/cull-of-zombies)

This repository includes all of the systems that was used in the game, from player movements, basic ai behavior and a basic inventory system. *Note: Some codes are highly unoptimized, use with caution!*
